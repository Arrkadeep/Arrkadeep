### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Cyber Security Student** at The Heritage Academy who loves building things. My background is in the creative arts—capturing moments through photography and designing visuals. 

Now, I am leveraging **AI-Augmented Coding** to turn my creative ideas into functional software. I don't just write syntax; I **orchestrate AI tools** to build apps that look good and solve real problems.

* 🎓 **Studying:** B.Sc. in Cyber Security.
* 💼 **Experience:** Associate Founder at Indrav Pvt. Ltd. & Freelance Photographer/Cinematographer.
* 🧠 **Philosophy:** Code is the medium, but the *product* is the goal.
